## Introduction
Florence is a plotting library for .NET/Mono.  While still in its early stages of development, Florence aims to provide a core API that is full featured, flexible core, object-oriented, and GUI Toolkit independent.  Additionally, it will provide a simpler API suitable for interactive use. Currently only the WinForms and BitMap backends are implemented.  Support for Gtk# is planned. System.Web support is leftover from the NPlot days and is in an unknown state.

## Origins
Florence began as a fork of the NPlot library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nplot/) and owes a good deal of its functionality to that project and its contributors.  Major contributors to NPlot include:
Matt Howlett

## The Name
Florence is named in honor of Florence Nightingale, an early prolific user of graphs for practical purposes.
